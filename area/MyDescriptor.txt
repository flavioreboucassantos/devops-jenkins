	# Serving static resources
	
		"From the application jar: To serve static resources from the application jar, you must place them in the META-INF/resources directory of your application.
		This location was chosen as it is the standard location for resources in jar files as defined by the Servlet spec.
		Even though Quarkus can be used without Servlet, following this convention allows existing code that places its resources in this location to function correctly."
		Example: src\main\resources\META-INF\resources\index.html
